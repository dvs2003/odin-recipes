    <h1>Lasagne Verdi al Forno</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagne.webp">
    <p>
        A recipe from my home in Emilia-Romagna, Italy. This lasagne verde made 
        with spinach pasta cannot be beaten. It's excellent if you want to impress 
        some guests — or even yourself. It may be a bit time-consuming, but it's well 
        worth the TLC you put into it.

    <h4>Ingridients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>5 ounces spinach - rinsed, stemmed, and dried</li>
        <li>5/8 cup semolina flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make pasta: Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just 
            below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add spinach, cover, and 
            steam until bright green, about 2 minutes. Squeeze spinach to remove excess 
            moisture and process in a food processor to make a paste. Add semolina, eggs, and 
            salt; process until smooth. Transfer mixture to a large bowl and stir in enough 
            flour to make a smooth dough. Knead briefly, then cover with a dish towel and set 
            aside.

            Make ragu: In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Cook and stir
            carrot, celery, onion, and bacon in hot butter until onion is translucent. Stir
            in pork, beef, and ham; cook and stir until crumbly and browned. Stir in beef 
            stock, tomato paste, and oregano. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low, 
            cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
        </li>

            While ragu is simmering, make béchamel: Combine butter and flour in a medium 
            saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk to make a roux. Remove from heat, let rest 
            for 1 minute, then whisk in warm milk. Return to heat and simmer for 10 minutes, 
            stirring constantly, until thickened. Season with salt and nutmeg. Remove from heat.
